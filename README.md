⚠️ Big Changes ⚠️ If you are here between upload and my tutorial video, just take a look at the prompt-anything script, its heavily documented. Check the deprecated folder for `quick-prompt.js` which is the old prompt-anything.js script. It's fun, but not easy to wield for beginners. I'll be making a video on how to use the new script later today. Set forth and be awesome.

# Artificial Citizens x Script Kit

<p>A collection of tools and experiments to bring AI to your fingertips with the power with ScriptKit.</p>

## How to Use

- Install [ScriptKit](https://www.scriptkit.com/) for your OS

- Once installed and opened (look for an app named Kit if you can't find it) navigate to the `kit` tab to get to the settings for the tool.

- Scroll or begin typing "kenv" and to see the option for managing KENVs. These are just separate environments to keep scripts separate

You now have access to the various tools we have to play with, the info for how to use each tool
lives in the repo.

You'll be prompted to install the dependencies for the scripts and enter any API keys needed.
