# Artificial Citizens x Script Kit

<p>A collection of tools and experiments to bring AI to your fingertips with the power with ScriptKit.</p>

## How to Use

- Install [ScriptKit](https://www.scriptkit.com/) for your OS

- Once installed and opened (look for an app named Kit if you can't find it) navigate to the `kit` tab to get to the settings for the tool.

- Scroll or begin typing "kenv" and to see the option for managing KENVs. These are just separate environments to keep scripts separate
